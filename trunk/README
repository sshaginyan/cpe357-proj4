Project 4 - mytar

Credits: man pages. 

To compile enter "make all" or "make mytar" or "make". To run follow the usage shown in the help file that can be viewed by entering "mytar --help".
Did not complete writing the archive and did not implement the extract operation and strict option. Only list and list verbose of an archive were completed. 
When listing with verbose, the date and time are not properly printed, it only prints the octal value obtained from the header block.
